The first step to building a full fledged web app: the AirBnB clone serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
Creating all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from basemodel.
Creating all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
